This website is made for Jane Smith, a fictional ceramist based in Austin, TX who wants to present and sell her work to potential customers or business clients. The site features links to her shop, a gallery of her work, information about the ceramist and her work methods, links to all her stockists and a contact page where you can leave her a message.


#### The goals for this website is to:
- Give a good and professional first impression to customers and retailers.
- Sell products to customers or retailers.
- Show customers where to buy the products.
- Show a wide range of items to a customer who's looking for a unique piece for their home.
- Show a wide range of items to a retailer who wants to find good handcrafted products for their store.
- Let users now that the ceramist is open to collaborations.
- Make it easy for users to contact the ceramist.

# UX


#### User Stories

1. As a potential customer I want to visit her shop to find out what products I can buy.
2. As a fan of the ceramist I would like to find where the nearest stockists are located so that I can purchase her products.
3. As a fan of the ceramist I would like to find her social media sites so that I can keep updated about her work.
4. As a curious new visitor to the website I would like to know more information about the ceramist and her work.
5. As a follower on social media I need to find her shop so that I can buy the product I saw in her latest Instagram post.
6. As a retailer I would like to view her collection of products to see if it's something I would buy for my store.
7. As a retailer I want to find the contact information so that I can get in touch with her for business inquiries.


#### Strategy 
I wanted to make a user-friendly website for the ceramist where she easily can offer her products to potential customers and retailers. The main focus when you enter the site is therefore a call to action button that leads straight to her shop on [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/). 

#### Surface
I wanted the site to be easy navigated with a clean and minimalistic design. The colors I’ve used for the project is a light grey, #777777, and a warm terracotta, #E2725B. I chose these colors because they are easy to read on screen and also the two most common colors on clay that’s used for pottery which gives the site an earthy tone and a thought through theme.  
- **Images**
The images used throughout the site is carefully choosen and is of great importence to showcase the ceramist work and to give a feeling about who she is. The photos of her work is all uniform in their apparence which gives a professional touch to the site. The photos of the ceramist herself on the about page and contact page has more of a personal character which gives the site a warm and welcoming feeling. The hero image on the landing page gives a calm first impression and also shows the skills of the ceramist.

#### Design result vs. wireframes
- ##### SHOP
I wanted the ceramist to somehow be able to sell her work through the website but since we haven't learned the technologies to implement that yet I decided that I'll show her work in an image gallery and let people make orders. This didn't feel absolute right with what I wanted to achieve and after have discussed the issue with my mentor we talked about adding a link to an online materketplace outside the page, like Etsy.
This solution was very satisfying and I think that the website gained a more clear purpose.
- ##### GALLERY
My main idea was to have a masonry gallery with images that got bigger when clicked so that a user can view the products more thorough. Unfortunately I'm lacking the skills to do this so I then decided to have bigger images and fewer in a row. I also choose between different titles for the page such as WORK and COLLECTION but I decided that GALLERY made most sense for the purpose. 



# Features

**Header** - A fixed header that exists on every page so it's easy accessible at all time. The logo is located to the left and by clicking it the user returns to the home page. The navigation menu is located to the right so that the user easy can navigate through the different pages.

**Navbar** - Each page features a responsive Bootstrap navbar that’s collapsed to a burger icon when viewing on smaller screens. 

The navbar has an hover effect so when the user hovers over the different pages the text changes color to a warm terracotta orange. The same color is used to show wich page the user is currently on.

**Home** - The home page features a hero image with the text "Jane Smith Ceramic Studio, Handcrafted Homeware" and a call to action button that guides the user to her shop. The image shows some of the ceramic items that she makes and this combined with the text immidiately gives the user clear information on what the website is about.

**Collection** - The collection page features a masonry gallery with images of all her work. 

**About** - The about page features a photo of the ceramist to give a personal feeling to who’s making the items. The page also provides a short text that gives some information about who she is and her thoughts about her work. You can also read that she’s available for collaborations.

**Stockists** - The stockist page features an unordered list with links to all her stockists so that users easily can access their websites and get information on where to purchase her items.

**Contact** - The contact page features a form where the user can fill in their name, email address and a message. The page also features another photo of the ceramist to make it personal.

**Footer** - A fixed footer that exists on every page. Located in the center of the footer are four social media icons with links to the ceramist social media pages. The links have the same hover effects as the navbar and changes color when hovering over them.

#### Features Left to Implement
- A webshop directly on her page so that customers easily can buy her work without beeing redirected to Etsy.com.

- A lightbox feature to the image galley so that customers can get a better view of the items.
