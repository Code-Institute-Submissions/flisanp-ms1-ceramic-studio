# Jane Smith Ceramic Studio

### Milestone Project 1
User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute


**A live version of the page can be viewed here**

Jane Smith Ceramic Studio is a website about a fictional ceramist who wants to present her work for a potential new customer and/or client. The site presents her work in form of a gallery of four different categories. You can also find a page with information about the ceramist, a page with links to her stockists and a contact page with information how to get in contact with her.

# UX


#### User Stories
- As a retailer I want to find the contact information so that I can get in touch with her for business inquiries.
- As a fan of the ceramist I would like to find where the stockists are located so that I can purchase her products.
- As a follower on social media I want to see the ceramist collection so that I can see if it’s something I want to buy.

#### Strategy 
I wanted to make a user-friendly website for the ceramist where she could present her collection for potential customers. I wanted the site to be easy navigated with a minimalistic design. It’s important both for a customer and a retailer to see what kinds of products the ceramist offers and they should immidiately see where to navigate to do this.

#### Surface
The colors I’ve used for the project is a light grey, #777777, and a warm terracotta, #E2725B. I chose these colors because they are easy to read on screen and also the two most common colors on clay that’s used for pottery which gives the site an earthy tone.

# Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

**Header** - A fixed header that exists on every page. The logo is located to the left and by clicking it the user returns to the home page. The navigation menu is located to the right so that the user easy can navigate through the different pages.

**Navbar** - Each page features a responsive Bootstrap navbar that’s collapsed when viewing on smaller screens. The navbar has an extra JavaScript function with a dropdown menu so the user easily can view the different categories in the collection.

The navbar has an hover effect so when the user hovers over the different pages the text changes color to a warm terracotta orange. The same color is used to show wich page the user is currently on.

**Home** - The home page features a hero image that shows some of the items in the collection. This will give the user an idea of what type of items the ceramist offers. 

On top of the image is a call to action button that guides the user to view the collection.

**Collection** - The collection page features a menu of the different categories followed by a masonry gallery with images of all the products. You can easily click on each category to get a better view of the category you’re intrested in.

**About** - The about page features a photo of the ceramist to give a personal feeling to who’s making the items. The page also provides a short text that gives some information about who she is and her thoughts about her work. You can also read that she’s available for collaborations.

**Stockists** - The stockist page features an unordered list with links to all her stockists so that users easily can access their websites and get information on where to purchase her items.

**Contact** - The contact page features a form where the user can fill in their name, email address and a message.

**Footer** - A fixed footer that exists on every page. Located in the center of the footer are four social media icons with links to the ceramist social media pages. The links have the same hover effects as the navbar and changes color when hovering over them.

##### Features Left to Implement
- A feature I would like to implement is a webshop so that customers easily can buy her work online.

- I would also like to add a lightbox to the different images so that customers can get a better view of the items.
