# UX


#### User Stories

1. As a potential customer I want to visit her shop to find out what products I can buy.

2. As a fan of the ceramist I would like to find where the nearest stockists are located so that I can purchase her products. ![user story](https://github.com/flisanp/ms1-ceramic-studio/blob/f9e8637f57e471259a8960ed993c9fed71ce8442/assets/screenshots/stockists.png)
3. As a fan of the ceramist I would like to find her social media sites so that I can keep updated about her work. ![user story](https://github.com/flisanp/ms1-ceramic-studio/blob/f9e8637f57e471259a8960ed993c9fed71ce8442/assets/screenshots/social-media.png)
4. As a follower on social media I need to find her shop so that I can buy the product I saw in her latest Instagram post.
5. As a retailer I would like to view her collection of products to see if it's something I would buy for my store.
6. As a retailer I want to find the contact information so that I can get in touch with her for business inquiries.

#### Strategy 
I wanted to make a user-friendly website for the ceramist where she easily can offer her products to potential customers and retailers. The main focus when you enter the site is therefore a call to action button that leads straight to her shop on [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/). 

#### Surface
I wanted the site to be easy navigated with a clean and minimalistic design. The colors I’ve used for the project is a light grey, #777777, and a warm terracotta, #E2725B. I chose these colors because they are easy to read on screen and also the two most common colors on clay that’s used for pottery which gives the site an earthy tone and a thought through theme.  

##### Images
The images used throughout the site is carefully choosen and is of great importence to showcase the ceramist work and to give a feeling about who she is. The photos of her work is all uniform in their apparence which gives a professional touch to the site. The photos of the ceramist herself on the about page and contact page has more of a personal character which gives the site a warm and welcoming feeling. The hero image on the landing page gives a calm first impression and also shows the skills of the ceramist.
